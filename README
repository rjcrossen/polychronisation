This is a repository featuring scripts used for a biologically plausible spiking neural network for my thesis.

sequential_spnet.m is a modified version of Izhikevich's 2004 spiking neural network that simply has functionality to run multiple network simulations in a row.

python_spnet.py has translated this network to Python with some slight quality of life improvements for future expansion on the features of the network.

polychron2.m is a slightly modified version of Izhikevich's algorithm to find polychromous groups with quality of life improvements.

polygroup.m is a helper function that is called from polychron2.m
